        Punk rock is a fast-paced, raw, and rebellious music genre that emerged in the 1970s. It is characterized by short, aggressive songs, often with simple guitar riffs, loud drums, and vocals that express anger or discontent with societal norms. Unlike other genres, punk rock tends to avoid polished production, emphasizing a DIY (do-it-yourself) ethic and a stripped-down, unrefined sound. The lyrics often tackle political, anti-establishment, or anti-authoritarian themes, setting it apart from more mainstream genres.

    <p>Machine Gun Kelly (MGK) initially gained fame as a rapper but shifted towards a punk rock sound with his 2020 album Tickets to My Downfall. This album marked a significant transition in his career, blending pop-punk influences with modern production, heavily inspired by artists like Blink-182. His association with punk rock was solidified by collaborations with Travis Barker, Blink-182's drummer, who produced the album. MGK's punk rock phase introduced the genre to a new generation, mixing it with mainstream pop elements while maintaining punk's rebellious spirit.
